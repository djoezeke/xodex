# Installing xodex

## Installation methods

Install xodex with package manager of choice.

### PyPI

For convenience, xodex is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/xodex/).

If installing from PyPI, we recommend installing xodex into an isolated environment, e.g., with `pipx`:

```console
$ pipx install xodex
```

However, `pip` can also be used:

```console
$ pip install xodex
```

### Docker

### GitHub Releases
