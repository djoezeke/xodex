# Versioning

xodex uses a custom versioning scheme in which the minor version number is bumped for breaking changes,
and the patch version number is bumped for bug fixes, enhancements, and other non-breaking changes.

xodex is widely used in production. However, we value the ability to iterate on new features quickly
and gather changes that _could_ be breaking into clearly marked releases.

Once xodex v1.0.0 is released, the versioning scheme will adhere to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). There is not a particular goal that must be achieved for
xodex to reach this milestone.

xodex's changelog can be [viewed on GitHub](https://github.com/djoezeke/xodex/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
