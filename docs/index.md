# xodex

xodex is a lightweight, extensible game engine framework built on top of
Pygame. It provides a small, focused set of tools for managing game projects,
defining scenes, and composing objects with clearly separated responsibilities
(drawing, logic updates, and event handling).

## Highlights

- Minimal, composable object model (Drawable, Logical, Eventful)
- Scene lifecycle and object manager for simple game structure
- Management CLI for scaffolding and running projects

## Quick installation

Install from PyPI:

```
pip install xodex
```
