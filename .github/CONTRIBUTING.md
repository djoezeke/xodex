I truly appreciate all the contributions from the community, whether it's proposing features, identifying bugs, or fixing mistakes! To ensure

## Ways to Contribute

There are multiple ways to contribute.

### Reporting an issue

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/djoezeke/xodex/issues/new/choose), assuming one does not already exist, and
describe your concern. Note you need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) for this.

Clearly describe the issue:

- If it is a bug, please describe how to **reproduce** it. If possible, attach a _complete example_ which demonstrates
  the error. Please also state what you **expected** to happen instead of the error.
- If you propose a change or addition, try to give an **example** what the improved code could look like or how to use
  it.
- If you found a compilation error, please tell us which **compiler** (version and operating system) you used and paste
  the (relevant part of) the error messages to the ticket.

Please stick to the provided issue template
[bug report](https://github.com/djoezeke/xodex/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yaml) if possible.

### Reporting a security vulnerability

You can report a security vulnerability according to our
[security policy](https://github.com/djoezeke/xodex/security/policy).

### Discussing a new feature

For questions, feature or support requests, please
[open a discussion](https://github.com/djoezeke/xodex/discussions/new). If you find a proposed answer satisfactory,
please use the "Mark as answer" button to make it easier for readers to see what helped and for the community to filter
for open questions.

### Proposing a fix or an improvement

Join an ongoing discussion or comment on an existing issue before starting to code. This can help to avoid duplicate
efforts or other frustration during the later review.

Create a [pull request](https://github.com/djoezeke/xodex/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+is%3Aopen) against the
`main` branch and follow the pull request template. In particular,

- describe the changes in detail, both the what and why,
- reference existing issues where applicable,
- add tests to maintain 100% test coverage,
- update the documentation as needed, and
- ensure the source code is amalgamated.

We describe all points in detail below.

All contributions (including pull requests) must agree to the
[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1](https://developercertificate.org). This is exactly the same one
created and used by the Linux kernel developers and posted on http://developercertificate.org/. This is a developer's
certification that he or she has the right to submit the patch for inclusion into the project.

## Recommended documentation

- The library’s [README file](https://github.com/djoezeke/xodex/blob/main/README.md) is an excellent starting point to
  understand its functionality.
- The [documentation page](https://djoezeke.github.io/xodex) is the reference documentation of the library.

We look forward to your contributions and collaboration to enhance the library!
